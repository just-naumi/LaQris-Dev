The dataset includes 154 images.
Qris-Positioning are annotated in YOLO26 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 432x432 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -7 and +7 degrees
* Random shear of between -5° to +5° horizontally and -5° to +5° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.8 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.37 percent of pixels
